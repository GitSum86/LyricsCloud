 It's like a—
 It's like a—
 It's like a—
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 I think all my life
 I never met anybody like you
 Sunrise all the time
 When I touch you
 It's like I'm waking up
 In a euphoria
 My insecurities
 Are things I never was
 I was a sad, sad song before we met
 But boy, your love is such a trip
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 Don't wake me 'cause I'm lucid dreamin'
 Meditatin' on your lips
 'Cause, baby, I'd be satisfied forever
 With a couple years of this
 Make me feel like in my birthday suit
 With you, I'm puttin' on the Ritz
 It's like a psychedelic switch (It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch)
 I'm in paradise
 I never met anybody like you
 I don't wanna hide
 When I'm with you
 It's like I'm waking up
 In a euphoria
 My insecurities
 Are things I never was
 It's like my whole life now is makin' sense
 I'm on the wildest trip and this
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 Don't wake me 'cause I'm lucid dreamin'
 Meditatin' on your lips
 'Cause, baby, I'd be satisfied forever
 With a couple years of this
 Make me feel like in my birthday suit
 With you, I'm puttin' on the Ritz
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 You feel just like home
 I'm not scared to show ya
 You feel just like home
 I'm not scared to show ya
 You feel just like home
 I'm not scared to show ya
 Yeah, all my insecurities
 Can't stand the way you look at me
 You lovin' me, it's hard to resist
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 (It's like a psychedelic, it's like a psychedelic)
 (It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch)
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 Don't wake me 'cause I'm lucid dreamin'
 Meditatin' on your lips
 'Cause, baby, I'd be satisfied forever
 With a couple years of this
 Make me feel like in my birthday suit
 With you, I'm puttin' on the Ritz
 It's like a psychedelic switch
 It's like a psychedelic, it's like a psychedelic
 It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch
 It's like a psychedelic, it's like a psychedelic
 It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch
 It's like a psychedelic, it's like a psychedelic
 It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch
 It's like a psychedelic, it's like a psychedelic
 It's like a—, it's like a psychedelic switch
