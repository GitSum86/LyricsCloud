We ain't good good, but we still good
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 I hate that we didn't make it to forever
 Probably ain't getting back together
 But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 I realize that I can't be your lover
 Let's just keep it honest with each other
 I'll be happy for you when you find another
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 Who knew it'd be like this?
 Usually, my exes turn to enemies
 But this is different
 'Cause we done got closer, now that you ain't with me
 
 All that love that we had
 Ain't no way we gon' forget that
 And your family love me like I'm family
 You know where you stand with me, so when they ask, tell them
 
 Right one, right place, wrong time
 Can't say we didn't try
 But you always been a real one, even though we ain't together
 It was real love, and baby, it's still love
 
 I hate that we ain't make it to forever
 Probably ain't getting back together
 But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 I realize that I can't be your lover
 Let's just keep it honest with each other
 I'll be happy for you when you find another
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 All them plans you made for me to be your Mrs
 All the stacks that you done spent on me at Lenox
 It don't go forgotten
 But we're happier apart than locked in (Locked in)
 No smoke with me, I promise, boy, I don't do drama
 It didn't work, but I hope you find another
 I wish you peace, I wish you good sex and good sleep
 Find the girl of your dreams
 'Cause I sleep well at night knowing this ain't meant to be
 
 Right one, right place, wrong time
 Can't say we didn't try
 All good things come to an end
 So, let's just learn the lessons and find loving again
 
 I hate that we ain't make it to forever
 Probably ain't getting back together
 But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 I realize that I can't be your lover (Lover)
 Let's just keep it honest with each other (Other)
 I'll be happy for you when you find another
 We ain't good good, but we still good
 
 No matter who you with, I want to see you happy (On God)
 Yeah, it didn't work out, but that don't mean you should attack me (21, 21)
 We enjoy the five star meals, but you was with me for the Zaxby's (Facts)
 Holding me down from the start (21)
 I used to be broke, I was actually (21)
 I hate that we didn't tie the knot, but shit, that's how life goes (On God)
 You always will say that I might blow (21)
 Got rich, and I paid for your lipo (21)
 I know the person you is (Yeah)
 That's why I still want to be friends (On God)
 If you want to open up a new salon, I still help pay for the wigs (Straight up)
 And I help with the lease (On God)
 You know I ain't never been cheap (21)
 Relationships don't always last, but let's not turn it to beef (21)
 I come through from time to time and have you grabbing them sheets (High)
 That's if you want to, I'm just playing, girl, stop smacking your teeth (21, 21)
 
 I hate that we didn't make it to forever
 But you know, probably ain't getting back together
 But that don't mean that I can't wish you better (Don't mean that I can't wish you better)
